# CPU 
A CPU core is a CPU’s processor. In the old days, every processor had just one core that could focus on one task at a time. Today, CPUs have been two and 18 cores, each of which can work on a different task. As you can see in our CPU Benchmarks Hierarchy, that can have a huge impact on performance. 

A core can work on one task, while another core works a different task, so the more cores a CPU has, the more efficient it is. 

Most processors can use a process called `simultaneous multithreading` or, if it’s an Intel processor, `Hyper-threading` (the two terms mean the same thing) to split a core into virtual cores, which are called threads. 

For example, 
AMD CPUs with four cores use simultaneous multithreading to provide eight threads, and most Intel CPUs with two cores use Hyper-threading to provide four threads.

Some apps take better advantage of multiple threads than others. Lightly-threaded apps, like games, don't benefit from a lot of cores, while most video editing and animation programs can run much faster with extra threads.
