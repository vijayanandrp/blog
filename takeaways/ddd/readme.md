# Domain Driven Design

Goal of **DDD** is not to focus on the programming languages. Rather it breaks down the business domain to facilitates the software development process

Business operate in the "real world"
Traditional Software development - progranmers  need the functionality. 

### Problem - In developers who are expert in creating softwares not good in other area of business(not a business experts).
<br />
### There is no synergisitc connection between a Guy who creates a software and a Guy who ended up using the software. 
Developer can create a logics and functions but they dont understand the real world business problem as expert does.

##### Domain Driven Design helps the Developer and Business Experts to work together to solve complex need and requirements of the software application.

Various tools that uses modeling design are Unified Model Language(UML), Class Diagrams, Entity Relationship Diagram, etc

### DDD is model driven approach focuses on mapping the concepts from the model to code and overarching software design.

overarching - arch over something

DDD can be used only in complex and large business domains.

#### Disadvantages of Domain Driven Design
* it doesnot have a framework
* it's not a set of patterns
* It's  not object oriented design
* It is not code focused
* It does not one-size-fits-all solution
* Its not a panacea (a solution or remedy for all difficulties and diseases)

# Phase 1 - DDD - Knowledge Crunching, Building Blocks & Contexts

Team of Developers & Team of Domain Experts 
Refining Knowledge
Search for meaning
Knowledge Crunching - Number Crunching 
(process large amounts of information or perform operations of great complexity, especially by computer.)
Speicfic Needs

## Best practices of Knowledge Crunching 
* Ubiquitous Language (use common terms that both understand the same point)
* Avoid technical implementation of software to domain experts
* Avoid side conversations
* Understand the domain experts "Hot Buttons" going on. Example - Sales cares about sales not on billing process. Accounting doesn't care about Advertising or Lead generations.
* Every domain will be different
* Understand the differences and the idnetify the common elements of linkage
