Airflow is the best orchestrator to run the multiple workflows

Core Components
1. Web Server
2. Scheduler
3. Metadatabase 
4. Executor
5. Worker

Behind the components there are two main components
---------------------------------------------------
Executor -----> How? ( Example - localexecutor, sequentialexecutor, kubernetesexecutor)
Worker ------> Where? (on which we want to run the job/workflow example - localexecutor->local process)


Architecture 

One node 
Web Server -----> MetaStore (DB) ----> Scheduler <-------> Executor/Queue
