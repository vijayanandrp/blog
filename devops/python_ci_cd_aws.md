## Pre-commit hooks
I love pre-commit as it fits so well in my workflow. I just commit as usual and pre-commit does all the checks which I sometimes forget. It speeds up development because the CI/CD pipeline is just way slower than executing the same steps locally. Especially for linting, itâ€™s an enormous time-saver to quickly run black over the code instead of committing, waiting for the CI/CD pipeline, finding an error, fixing that error locally, pushing, and waiting again for the CI/CD pipeline.
