gsub is the normal sub in python - that is, it does multiple replacements by default.

The method signature for `re.sub is sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)`

If you want it to do a single replacement you specify count=1:

```python
In [2]: re.sub('t', 's', 'butter', count=1)
Out[2]: 'buster'
re.I is the flag for case insensitivity:

In [3]: re.sub('here', 'there', 'Here goes', flags=re.I)
Out[3]: 'there goes'
You can pass a function that takes a match object:

In [13]: re.sub('here', lambda m: m.group().upper(), 'Here goes', flags=re.I)
Out[13]: 'HERE goes'

result = re.sub(r"(\d.*?)\s(\d.*?)", r"\1 \2", string1)


import re
strings = ["Important text,      !Comment that could be removed", "Other String"]
[re.sub("(,[ ]*!.*)$", "", x) for x in strings]





>>> re.sub(r'(foo)', r'\1123', 'foobar')
'J3bar'

This works:

>>> re.sub(r'(foo)', r'\1hi', 'foobar')
'foohibar'

re.sub(r'(foo)', r'\g<1>123', 'foobar')
Relevant excerpt from the docs:

In addition to character escapes and backreferences as described above, \g will use the substring matched by the group named name, as defined by the (?P...) syntax. \g uses the corresponding group number; \g<2> is therefore equivalent to \2, but isnâ€™t ambiguous in a replacement such as \g<2>0. \20 would be interpreted as a reference to group 20, not a reference to group 2 followed by the literal character '0'. The backreference \g<0> substitutes in the entire substring matched by the RE.

```
